Hello! I'm Jordi.

Hope this finds you well! 💻

This this supposed to help me practicing Quarto Markdown and also get used to documenting all my knowledge and progress through the course.

I will do my best to write all my documentation in English and stick to it cause my English it's getting a bit rusty, but no prometo nada. 🤷‍♂️
