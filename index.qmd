# Hello! I'm Jordi.

## Hope this finds you well! ðŸ’» {.border-0}

#### This this supposed to help me practicing Quarto Markdown and also get used to documenting all my knowledge and progress through the course.

#### I will do my best to write all my documentation in English and stick to it cause my English it's getting a bit rusty, but no prometo nada. ðŸ¤·

#### So besides the coding part, I'm also looking forward to write a lot so I can improve my writting, grammar and technical vocabulary.

#### At the moment there's only two sections in this website =\> [The Programmer Dictionary](https://codingjordi.github.io/Course-documentation/programmer-dictionary.html){style="color: #409AF5;"} & [Markdown](https://codingjordi.github.io/Course-documentation/md-basics.html){style="color: #409AF5;"}
