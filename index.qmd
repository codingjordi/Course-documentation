# Hello! I'm Jordi. 

## Hope this finds you well! ðŸ’» {.text-decoration-none}

#### This this supposed to help me practicing Quarto Markdown and also get used to documenting all my knowledge and progress through the course.

#### I will do my best to write all my documentation in English and stick to it cause my English it's getting a bit rusty, but no prometo nada.  ðŸ¤·

#### So besides the coding part, I'm also looking forward to write a lot so I can improve my writting, grammar and technical vocabulary.
